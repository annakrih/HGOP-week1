   <dt>Why shoule you use Linux? What er the pros and cons?</dt>
   <dd> When you use Linux you can make your own changes, and even distribute them if you wish. You also have power over everything that you would like to change. It can also be used in different technology, that are not personal computers, such as to host a website, on servers and more. 
Another pro of using Linux are less risk of malware, and the fact that it is free. Cons of using Linux are most notably compatibility, since not all software or hardware are compatible with Linux and that it's not as as user friendly as Windows or Mac.

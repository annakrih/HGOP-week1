# Day 3 - Privision enviroment in AWS

I was able to sign up for an AWS account and add an Administrator IAM user, create a EC2 instance and deploy a docker container to ECS. 

A link to the deployd website: http://ec2-18-217-150-181.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

I started with the scripting but did not finish them or do the .env file.
